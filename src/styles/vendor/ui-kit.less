// TG
// Notice: by building tg-ui-app-* in dev mode by webpack it uses
// "source" field in a dependency e.g. @tg/ui and build from its sources
// and include needed CSS modules. When we build in production mode it
// uses dist folder so doesn't have any information about CSS modules.
// So we need to include dist/index.css implicitly here.
